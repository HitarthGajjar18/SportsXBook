        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          SportsXBook started in 2023 with a simple mission: make booking sports facilities as easy as ordering food online.
          Founded by a team of sports enthusiasts, we realized how difficult it was to find and book quality venues for recreational sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began as a small platform for booking pool tables has now grown into India's premier booking service for multiple sports facilities,
          including bowling alleys and pickleball courts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we connect thousands of players with the best facilities across the country, making sports more accessible for everyone.
